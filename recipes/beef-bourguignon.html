    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>"Don't be intimidated by its fancy name, beef bourguignon is just a classic beef stew," according to culinary producer Nicole McLaughlin (a.k.a. NicoleMcMom). Here are a few of her best beef bourguignon tips and tricks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you remove the beef from the marinade, make sure it's completely dry before you brown it so it can achieve the color you're after (the flavor has already been absorbed).</li>
        <li>You'll know the beef is ready to flip when it easily releases from the pan. "It'll tell you when it's ready," says Nicole.</li>
        <li>Nicole uses a mixture of cremini and button mushrooms, but you can use whatever mushrooms you like. Don't salt the mushrooms: That will draw out the water, which will create steam and prevent browning.</li>
    </ul>
