    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrot and 1/4 cup green onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic powder and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in rice, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring only once or twice, until rice is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; cook for 2 minutes.</p>
    
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Push rice mixture to the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the middle. Add butter to the center of the pan. When melted, pour eggs into the center. Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set, about 3 minutes. Stir eggs into the rice mixture. Stir in soy sauce and rice vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes.</p>
    
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Serve immediately topped with Sriracha mayo and green onions.</p>

    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Cook's Notes:</p>
    <p>You can use leftover pork, steak, or shrimp in place of chicken.</p>
    <p>Avoid stirring too much when the rice is added so that it will get lightly crispy and caramelized around the edges... that's the best part!</p>
